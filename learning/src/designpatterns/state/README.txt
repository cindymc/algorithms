The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  The object will appear to
change its class.  It's an alternative to putting lots of conditionals in your code.

It differs from the Strategy pattern in that Strategy is a flexible alternative to subclassing.  With Strategy, you can
change the behavior of a class at runtime by composing it with a different object.
